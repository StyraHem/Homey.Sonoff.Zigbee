This is a template for creating Zigbee Light Device apps for Homey using SDK 3 (firmware 5x->)

Whats needed:
- An Github account (free)
- The device(s) you want to add (or really good info regarding the Zigbee cluster data for it)
- A code editor, like Microsoft Visual Studio (free) (you can code directly in Github but I do not recommend it)
- Homey ;)

Start by creating a repository for the app by surfing to https://github.com/JohanBendz/Zigbee_Light_Device_Template and click the green button labeled "Use this template" (you will have to login unless you are already).

Choose a name for your repository and write a short description.
You can start with a private repository but I urge everyone to later go public if and when you publish your app to Homey App Store; This way we can continue to share knowledge and support each other.

The template contains dummy files for a complete app, those needs to be replaced or updated.

What you need to do is to edit:
- the file LICENSE
    Change to your name and make sure year is correct.

- the file README.txt
    Change the text to reflect the app you are creating.

- the file app.js
    Change "My Zigbee App.." to reflect the name of your app.

- the file .homeychangelog.json
    Edit the test to reflect what you have done.
    Add a new section for each version update.

- *do NOT edit the file app.json in the top folder  - this file is created by homeycomposer*

- the files in the .homeycompose folder structure
    Edit app.json
        Change id, name and description to reflect your app.
        The text in description will be visible as Title in Homey App Store.
        Update version as needed.
        Edit author and contributors as needed.

- the files in the assets folder structure
   Replace icon and images.

- the files in the drivers folder structure
    The name of the folders are "templates", make a copy of the mathing one and name the copy so it reflects the device you are adding. eg. RGB_Bulb_Color_Ambiance or Brand_Device.
    When you have a new folder with the name you decided containing the files from a template folder you need to edit or replace:
    - device.js
        Change the text after Class (eg. lightColorAmbiance) to something reflecting your device and make sure you put the same text after modules.export.

    - driver.compose.json
        Change the name of the device to something that your users will understand.
        Change the manufacturerName to reflect your device (get this from an interview, see below).
        Change the ProductId to reflect your device (get this from an interview, see below).
        Edit the instructions for learnmode if needed to reflect how your device is made ready for pairing.
   
    Replace icon and images
        Images should be high quality product photos of the device with a white or transparens background.
        Icon should be easy to understand, this is what your users will see in the mobile app / web gui.
        Never use images or icons that you do not have rights to use, if using free media make sure to give credits in the readme.txt file (top folder).
        Athom can help create icons for free if needed (https://github.com/athombv/homey-vectors-public).

Interview of devices
- All devices that is to be added to the app should be interviewed so that you have the correct Zigbee data at hand, this is done using Homey Developer Tools: https://developer.athom.com/tools/zigbee. Copy the result from the popup (click on the copy icon) and paste it somewhere you can read it better.

Good luck and have fun :)
